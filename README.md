  - Can't find xsanscript. indic_transliteration package must be updated.
- http://jyotisha.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jyotisha.html should automatically have good updated documentation - unless there are build errors. Current build errors:
  - indic_transliteration cannot be installed. [Stackexchange question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45929148/read-the-docs-pip-pypi-dependency-installation-error).
